To use on Meta Quest 3 headsets, download the apk file from the most recent release and install it on your VR device. The recommended tool is Meta Quest Developer Hub. 
- To use MQDH, download from [Oculus Downloads](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/), and run the installer after unpacking the zipped folder. 
- Once the program is running, use the charging cord that comes with the headset or some other data transfer cable for the Quest 3 and plug your headset into the computer. 
  - You may need to confirm some prompts in the headset to allow the computer to connect to it and transfer data, so make sure the headset is on when you plug it in. 
- Once the app identifies the headset, select your headset in the Device Manager tab. 
- From here, open File Explorer to where the apk file is downloaded, and drag the file from Explorer into Meta Quest Developer Hub. 
- As you are dragging the file over, 2 options for what to do with the file will appear, drop the file on the option on the right. 
  - You should see a progress bar appear as the program gets installed. 
- After this, you are free to unplug the headset and open the app. 
- In the headset's App Library menu, navigate to the Unknown Source section.
- Collection Game should appear in this menu, simply click it to launch the program.

> [!CAUTION]
> While developed on the Quest 3, the program should run on the Quest 2 as long as the Passthrough toggle remains off.
> The program has not been tested on other headsets. If attempting to install and run on other devices, proceed with caution.

To play, use the grip button (lower button on the back of the controller) on the controller to grab objects. There will be a number of brushes with different lengths and brush sizes that can be used for decontaminating. By default a PPE Model will be present with randomized contaminated sections. A panel to the side has buttons for switching to the area decon mode, switching back to personnel decon, revealing the results of the decon attempt, resetting, and turning on the passthrough feature.
